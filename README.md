# Machine Learning From Scratch

This repository documents my journey of learning Machine Learning fundamentals by
implementing core algorithms from scratch while trying to use minimal built in functions.

The goal of this project is not to build production-ready models, but to deeply
understand **how machine learning algorithms work internally**, why they succeed,
and where they fail.

This repository will grow incrementally as I continue learning and experimenting.
Each notebook is written as a **self-contained learning guide**, intended to help
both myself and other beginners understand the algorithm clearly.

## Current Implementations

### 1. Linear Regression (From Scratch)

**Concepts covered:**
- Intuition behind linear regression
- Mathematical formulation
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss
- Gradient Descent update rules
- Dimensionality and shape analysis
- Learning rate behavior and convergence
- Visualization of best-fit line during training
- Boundary conditions and failure cases

**Implementation details:**
- Built entirely using NumPy
- No use of `sklearn.linear_model`
- Includes experiments with hyperparameters and noise

## How to Use This Repository

- Each folder corresponds to one algorithm
- Notebooks are designed to be read **top-to-bottom**
- Explanations are written in Markdown cells
- Code is intentionally kept simple and explicit

You can:
- Clone the repo
- Open notebooks in Jupyter / Google Colab
- Modify parameters and run experiments

## Learning Philosophy

This project follows a **progressive learning approach**:

1. Understand the intuition
2. Study the mathematics
3. Implement from scratch
4. Visualize behavior
5. Break the model intentionally
6. Reflect on limitations

Rather than optimizing for speed or performance, the focus is on **clarity and understanding**.

## Disclaimer

This repository represents a **learning journey**.  
The implementations may evolve over time as understanding improves.

Feedback, suggestions, and discussions are always welcome.
